    <h1>The Basic of HTML</h1>
   
    <p> This webpage my idea was to learn the basics of HTML, I develop with the right elements to do it!</p>
    <p>Basically the elements used here are generic but quite important, the <code>< p ></code>  tag where this text is now is for paragraphs, and the larger text above is a <code>< h1 ></code>  tag used for heading!</p>

    <h2>Bold & Italic</h2>
   <h3> This section we will examine the meaning of bold and italics.</h3>
   <p> This is <strong> bold text </strong>, which is normally used to emphasise that this text is important.
    There are two ways to do this, using a  <code>< b ></code> , but this option is not recommended,
     mainly because screen readers will ignore it. The best way is to use the tag <code>< strong ></code>, which will make your website more accessible.</p>
     <p>Now this is a <em>cursive text</em>, as said in the previous text, there are two ways, the <code>< i > </code>, which is the easy way, just visual, and the  <code>< em ></em></code> , which is the right way, to remind that this is not just a text thing, is important to help people who use a screen reader.</p>
